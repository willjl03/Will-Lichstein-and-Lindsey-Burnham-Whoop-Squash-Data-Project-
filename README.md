Important! The files when you click on them are read only! 
To download the raw file, click on it and open the read only version; then on the line where it says code or blame, further on the right there
will be a group of three buttons with the leftmost saying raw, the middle having a window icon, and the rightmost having a download button; click
download, and you will have the raw file on your computer ready to read! Just make sure you do it for both files!
