Lindsey and I's final project uses Whoop data from squash players to look at the relationship 
between strain (a Whoop variable built on workout statistics) and sleep performance (a Whoop variable
built on sleep statistics) on recovery score (a variable make by Whopp built on strain and sleep). 
We use a few statistical models to look at this. The code is easily accessible in the file 
'Final Project Writeup.rmd' and the HTML version is easily readable in the 'Final Project Writeup.html' file.
We'd recommened looking at the HTML first then the RMD after. Enjoy!
